# exploringTwilioAPI

This is my Django project where I'm both doing a technical coding challenge as well as explore some of the other functionalities of the Twilio API.

Run 'python manage.py runserver' // sets up server on port 8000
Tested with ngrok
'ngrok http 8000'

ngrok server url will have to be put in 2 locations:
* angular app requests
* django views

requirements have to be downloaded and can be found in requirements.txt
twilio==5.3.0
django-twilio==0.8.0
Django==1.9
if I am missing any, please let me know! 

endpoints:

* /sss
* /asdasd
* /sdasd
* /sadasd
* /asdasd
* /asdasd
* /asd
* /asd
